  mapping:
    5: 3V3 (NC)
    21: A0 (NC)
    22: A1
    30: ENABLE (NC)
    32: A0
  notes:
  - A0 signal is on pin 32 by default via R94, change it to R95 to enable secondary
  - EN signal is connected to pin 29 by default via R97, change it to R96 to enable
    secondary
  - Power via 3V3 swapping resistors R49 and R50
