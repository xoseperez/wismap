WisMAP - WisBlock Pin Mapper
==========================

WisMAP identifies potential pin conflicts between modules in [RAKwireless WisBlock](https://www.rakwireless.com/en-us/products/wisblock) integrations. It is a port of the official [WisBlock Pin Mapper spreadsheet](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/LoRa/WisBlock/Pin-Mapper/WisBlock-IO-Pin-Mapper.xlsx) with a web interface and a CLI tool.

Features:

* Browse all WisBlock modules with filtering by type (filters persist across navigation)
* View detailed pin mappings and documentation links for any module
* Combine modules on a base board and detect pin conflicts, I2C address collisions, and signal incompatibilities
* Export combine results to Markdown or PDF
* Shareable URLs for combine configurations
* Supports ~140 modules across all WisBlock types (Base, Core, IO, Sensor, Power)

The REST API (Flask) and the web frontend (React) have been developed with the assistance of [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), Anthropic's AI coding tool.

## Deploy with Docker

The quickest way to run WisMAP is with Docker Compose:

```
git clone https://github.com/xoseperez/wismap
cd wismap
docker compose up -d --build
```

The web interface will be available at http://localhost:5000.

To stop the service:

```
docker compose down
```

Alternatively, using plain Docker:

```
docker build -t wismap .
docker run -p 5000:5000 wismap
```

## Deploy manually

Requirements: Python 3, Node.js, `virtualenv` and `make`.

```
git clone https://github.com/xoseperez/wismap
cd wismap
make init
make frontend-install
make frontend-build
make serve
```

This starts the Flask server on port 5000, serving both the API and the built frontend.

## Development

For local development, run the Flask API and the Vite dev server simultaneously in two terminals:

```
make serve
```

```
make frontend-dev
```

The Vite dev server proxies `/api` requests to Flask on port 5000 and provides hot module replacement.

## Updating module definitions

The repository includes a pre-built `data/definitions.yml` with ~140 module definitions. To update it from the latest official spreadsheet:

```
make import
```

This downloads the spreadsheet, parses each sheet, applies patches from `data/patches/*.yml`, and regenerates `definitions.yml`.

## CLI

WisMAP also provides a command-line interface for terminal usage. See [CLI.md](CLI.md) for full documentation.

Quick examples:

```
python wismap.py -v              # show version
python wismap.py list            # list all modules
python wismap.py info rak12008   # show module details
python wismap.py combine rak6421 rak5802 rak5801 empty empty rak12002 rak18001
```

## Roadmap

* Suggest which module should go to which slot
* Add dependencies between modules (i.e. RAK14011 depends on RAK14004)
